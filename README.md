*2020-07-14* - Released patch v1.1 fixing some corrupt images - you will receive a link to download it if you already requested the data.

## Description

Mapillary Street-level Sequences (MSLS) is a large-scale long-term place recognition dataset that contains 1.6M street-level images.

## üî• Using MSLS

We've included an implementation of a PyTorch Dataset in [datasets/msls.py](mapillary_sls/datasets/msls.py).
It can be used for evaluation (returning database and query images) or for training (returning triplets).
Check out the [demo](demo.ipynb) to understand its usage.


#### üìä Standalone evaluation script

A [standalone evaluation script](evaluate.py) is available for all tasks. It reads the predictions from a text file ([example](files)) and prints the metrics.

Here we show results of models consisting of a Resnet50 backbone followed by Generalized Mean Layer. The models are trained with either the standard triplet loss or the uncertainty-aware Bayesian triplet loss. All models are trained with standard hard negative mining on image resolution 224x224.

Results on test set (Miami, Athens, Buenos Aires, Stockholm, Bengaluru, Kampala):

## üì¶ Package structure

- `images_vol_X.zip`: images, split into 6 parts for easier download.
- `metadata.zip`: a single zip archive containing the metadata.
- `patch_vX.Y.zip`: unzip any patches on top of the dataset to upgrade.

All the archives can be extracted in the same directory resulting in the following tree:

- train_val
    - `city`
        - query / database
            - images/`key`.jpg
            - seq_info.csv
            - subtask_index.csv
            - raw.csv
            - postprocessed.csv
- test
    - `city`
        - query / database
            - images/`key`.jpg
            - seq_info.csv
            - subtask_index.csv

The meta files include the following information:

- **raw.csv**: raw data recorded during capture
	- key
	- lon
	- lat
	- ca
	- captured_at
	- pano

- **seq_info.csv**: Sequence information
	- key
	- sequence_id
	- frame_number

- **postprocessed.csv**: Data derived from the raw images and metadata
	- key
	- utm (easting and northing)
	- night
	- control_panel
	- view_direction (Forward, Backward, Sideways)
	- unique_cluster

- **subtask_index.csv**: Precomputed image indices for each subtask in order to evaluate models on (all, summer2winter, winter2summer, day2night, night2day, old2new, new2old)
